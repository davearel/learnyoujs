JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
While its origin is within the traditional desktop web browser, newer
platforms have increased the broad usage of JavaScript as a
programming langage.

One of the most recent and exciting developments has been Node.js.
Node.js is an engine which executes JavaScript in a server environment.

While most problems solved in `learnyoujs` will be applicable to both
environments, we'll mainly focus on JavaScript on the server and forgo
the often flawed and complicated use of the browsers DOM.
